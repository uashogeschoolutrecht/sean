## Summary

Team Data & Analytics is starting project Sean: develop an algorithm that performs sentiment analysis on text with the aim of providing a sentiment score, specifically aimed at HU student-related data (STudent Information Point requests, open-ended questions from student questionnaires, HU twitter, etc.). We aim to develop a product that can be re-used (and further developed) within the HU for any purpose and goal, and will become available through GitHub.
