# SEAN

![](images/Sean_branding.png)

Team Data & Analytics is starting project Sean: develop an algorithm that performs sentiment analysis on text with the aim of providing a sentiment score, specifically aimed at HU student-related data (STudent Information Point requests, open-ended questions from student questionnaires, HU twitter, etc.). We aim to develop a product that can be re-used (and further developed) within the HU for any purpose and goal, and will become available through GitHub.

*Development team: Anne Leemans (lead) & Fraukje Coopmans*

## Roadmap
Current status: Fase A, version 0.1 complete

Full roadmap from start to finish consists of roughly two phases (which can be developed in parallel):

### Fase A
Develop SEAN

### Fase B
Develop package that contains a modular product (SEAN)
